Daily Work Task Tracker

Welcome to the Daily Work Task Tracker Application!

This is a demo app built using Sinatra and ActiveRecord. The Daily Work Task Tracker will allow users to submittheir daily work tasks with attributes such as a title, date, description of the task, time to complete the task, and any notes they care to provide. This idea was brought about when a few my coworkers were having trouble logging their progress for work tasks.

Installation:

1. Clone or download this project
2. cd into the daily_work_task_tracker directory
3. run bundle install
4. run shotgun
5. Open your browser and enter the given local url provided by the shotgun server.
